Your task is to analyze user queries and determine whether the user intends to **switch from their current application** to another one. 

Instructions:
1. If the query indicates the user wants to switch applications, output:
   {
       "switch_intent": true,
       "target_application": "<name of the intended application>"
   }

2. If the query does not indicate switching, output:
   {
       "switch_intent": false,
       "target_application": null
   }

3. Always consider explicit and implicit cues in the query, e.g., "I want to go to assistant" likely implies switching to the "Assistant" application.

4. Only choose one target application per query. If unclear, choose the most probable based on context.
